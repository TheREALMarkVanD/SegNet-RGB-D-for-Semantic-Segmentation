# SegNet-RGB-D-for-Semantic-Segmentation
PyTorch implementation of SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder trained on NYUDv2 Dataset


https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html - Download the Labelled dataset(2.8GB)

https://medium.com/@nikdenof/segnet-from-scratch-using-pytorch-3fe9b4527239 - This helpmed me develop the model
https://github.com/ankurhanda/sunrgbd-meta-data - (1) - Excellent repo for SUNRGBD train-test labels. If you want to increase the data size, SUNRGBD is a larger dataset compared to NYUDv2, however the image quality is not that great.
https://github.com/chrischoy/SUN_RGBD - related to (1) where they optimize the repo further.
